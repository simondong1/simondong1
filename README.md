Hi, Iâ€™m @simondong1

I am a 3rd year student studying physics and computer science at Carnegie Mellon University. 
Much of my coding on github are private for CMU courses/internships/research projects (ex. 17214(Principles of Software Construction), 15440(Distributed Systems), 15213(Intro to Computer Systems)), but there are some sneak peaks of some projects/competitions I did.

Feel free to reach me at anytime at sixiangd@andrew.cmu.edu
